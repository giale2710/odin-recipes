    <h1>Lasagna Recipes</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        · Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
        · Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
        · Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        · Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
        · Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
        · Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        · Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
        · Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
